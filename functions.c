// macros versus inline
// macros replace text during preprocessor while inline is just a compiler directive 
// because macro is text copied good to do __ paramaters and any local variables used in parameters
// dont pass in type of paremeters in macro
// can't really return values from macros because no function call being made
// usually, don't have any value assigned to value of macro funciton because want to make multiline with multiple statements
// however, if oneline can make statement as seen in min
// generally put macro in header files because going to get copied anways

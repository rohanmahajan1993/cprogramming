char ch = 15; \\1 bytes
unsigned char c = 25; \\ 1 byte only positive
int i = 25; \\ 2 to 4 bytes
long  = 15; \\has more bytes than int
float f = 3.0 \\decimal value
double d = 5.0 \\has more bytes than float and thus has higher range
const double f = 5.0; \\const just lets compiler know value won't change; can impact optimizations, checking, and make it clearer for programmer
